If you had told me five years ago that this is where I'd be I'd have laughed in your face. I didn't get my first computer as an adult until I was 25, and a smart phone likely a year after that, proudly proclaiming myself a luddite. But it's not that I had a fear of technology, per se, I just didn't have the means to access it nor the interest. I believed that technology was responsible for making people less present in their daily lives and with their loved ones. 

I haven't diverged entirely from these beliefs but my feelings have evolved. After stumbling into a technical support position I very quickly realized that I loved learning the ins and outs of the product we were supporting. My role transformed into one that was much more technical, centered on problem solving, reading various API's and our Ruby code base, and figuring out how everything fitted together in order to pinpoint the cause of various bugs and issues. I hadn't been sure until that point that writing code was something I truly wanted to do, but after being elbow deep in it for some time it became crystal clear. I not only wanted to read it and understand it but I wanted to write it and that is when I decided to come to Flatiron.

I know without a shadow of a doubt that this is something I can do and, with much dedication, will learn to excel at. And I believe the industry is severely lacking in diverse voices at the table. Programmers are writing our future and I want women, lgbt people, people of color and working class people who haven't been afforded access to Computer Science degrees and STEM programs to be a part of writing that future too.
