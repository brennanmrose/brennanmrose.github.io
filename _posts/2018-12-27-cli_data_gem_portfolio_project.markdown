I learned quite quickly that deciding which site to scrape is often the single most important decision of the entire scraping project, as one must consider the following:

* Will the user be interested in reading the content of this site?
* Will it be interesting?
* How many layers deep can I scrape?
* Does it load with JS or not?

In selecting that first site I carefully considered the above questions, yet I neglected to consider one essential detail - is the html of the site nested or not? After having created the project, built out the structural CLI, and done a ton of scraping I realized that because the content was not nested it was extremely challenging to nest it within the scraper. I tried several different avenues, including extensive hardcoding, and the gem looked like a cluttered disaster.

The best decision I made was to change the site - even though I had spent a little over a week working on the previous one. After that, the next site seemed like a walk in the park, and I was able to dedicate much more time towards object oriented programming and making my code clean and readable. I had the time to be able to play with the flow more and get creative with the presentation. I am so glad I didn't stick with the old site, even after having put so much time on it, because it never could have demonstrated my understanding of Ruby nor been as fun as the project I have completed today. Sometimes the best lesson is to let go and move on, but only after having made 1,000% sure that that is the right thing to do, and do so with good reasoning but never because it feels too hard.
